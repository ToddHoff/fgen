# fgen


<I>fgen</I> takes a system specification and generates code based on
the specification.  The idea is a programmer can make a simple
description of something and then generate a lot of infrastructure
type code based on the specification. <I>fgen</I> also makes
it easy to add new system specifications, extensions to existing specifications,
and different code generators for specifications.
<P>

Systems can be anything, but they usually map to something relatively complex
where automatic code generation can provide a big productivity win. 
<A HREF="#sm">State machines</A> are one such area where a state machine
can be simply specified and a lot of code generated.
